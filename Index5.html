    <p>Naruto is the son of the 4th Hokage and Kuzhina who is a descendant of the Uzumaki clan. Naruto himself was born in a village called Konoha. After Naruto's birth his parents died from an attack from the 9 tailed weasel to protect Naruto. Before Naruto's father died, he sealed some of the Kyubee's chakra into Naruto's young body. After everything was over and Naruto's two people were buried, Naruto grew up to be a stupid and naughty child. But behind Naruto's mischief and stupidity, there is a dream to become Hokage. The Hokage himself is the person who leads the fire nation or Konoha village. In Naruto's village, he was always shunned by his friends and hated by the Konoha villagers. Alone he lives even washing clothes, eating and everything is done alone. So Naruto was very independent. After entering the genin level ninja school, Naruto began to meet his friends who acknowledged his existence. Naruto's friends are Sakura, Sasuke, Shikamaru, Chouji, Kiba, Shino, Hinata, Lee, Neji, Tenten, Ino and many more. At school, Naruto is famous for his stupidity in using jutsu / moves. Regarding the jutsu that was mastered for the first time, it was the shadow move which according to Naruto was the most difficult to master, but thanks to the forbidden scroll he stole, Naruto was able to master the 1000 shadow moves. This is a cool move and it was unimaginable that Naruto could master it before. After that a team was formed consisting of 3 people namely Sakura, Sasuke and Naruto led by Master Kakashi. For team Kakashi called team 7.</p>
